# Rapido Ride Data Analysis and Dashboard Reporting using Power BI

## Project Description
I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for Rapido ride data analysis, enabling insights into rider behavior, performance metrics, traffic patterns, time analysis, and payment trends. The dashboard helps stakeholders make data-driven decisions and improve service efficiency.

## Page 1: Overview of Rapido
Displays overall ride statistics including:

Total rides

Average driver rating

Average distance covered

Maps show distribution of drop locations across cities (Ahmedabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata).

Fare summary and ride type breakdown (Auto, Bike, Car).

Vehicle types analyzed (Bike, Electric, Hatchback, Sedan, SUV).

Allows filtering by ride status (Completed, Cancelled) and rider type.

## Page 2: Rider Customer Analysis
Detailed table with columns:

Driver ID, Customer ID, Ride ID

Pickup and drop locations

Distance, estimated time, estimated fare

Cancellation reasons (e.g., Traffic Delay, High Surge Pricing, Customer No-show)

Highlights customer and driver ratings.

Supports filtering by vehicle type and ride type.

Emphasizes rider satisfaction and cancellation patterns.

## Page 3: Rider Performance
Aggregates driver and customer ratings per driver.

Shows sum of ratings and total distance covered.

Bar charts break down ratings and distances by vehicle type (Bike, Electric, Sedan, SUV, Hatchback).

Vehicle type distribution by ride type (Auto, Bike, Car).

Helps assess driver efficiency and vehicle performance.

## Page 4: Time Analysis
Analyzes estimated vs. actual trip time.

Visuals include:

Bar chart comparing actual and estimated time gaps.

Line chart showing time trends.

Summarizes total estimated and actual times.

Helps identify delays and improve time management.

## Page 5: Traffic & Delays
Explores impact of traffic conditions on ride performance.

Details include:

Driver ID, Ride ID, Customer ID

Actual time, distance, traffic condition, estimated fare

Traffic breakdown (High, Medium, Low).

Visuals show estimated time vs. actual time by traffic level.

Supports operational adjustments to reduce delays.

## Page 6: Payment & Payment Method Analysis
Lists payment details:

Payment method (Cash on Delivery, Debit Card, Credit Card, UPI, Wallet)

Payment status (Success, Pending, Failed)

Drop location, distance, fare

Bar charts summarize payment method usage.

Identifies most preferred and most problematic payment channels.

Useful for optimizing payment strategies.
